    text: 'I just dropped off two pallets of flooring, they opened their dock early for me, the people were passionate about the jobs they provide to their community, the "boss man" came out and made sure I was being taken care of and not having to wait to unload, employees were fast, efficient, polite, well groomed, skilled, and gave myself and my co-driver 2 bottles of cold water each when they realized we were from out of town and were just winging it in the desert. Kinda makes me wish I lived nearby just so I could patronize such an awesome business.',

    text: 'I can\'t say enough good things about James, Terry, Chris and this company. They just wrapped a ten-location flooring project for one of our customers in the Phoenix Area and throughout the whole process, they maintained excellent communication in relaying project progress, details and completion photos to us at our offices here in Ohio. They even handled the logistics for us regarding the placement and relocating of the refrigeration trucks needed for perishables to be stored while the restaurant coolers were getting their new floors. They worked with us and our customer to schedule and complete these jobs at a time and in a manner that was the least disruptive to our customer\'s business so I would highly recommend them for any flooring job needed and look forward to working with them again in the future.',
