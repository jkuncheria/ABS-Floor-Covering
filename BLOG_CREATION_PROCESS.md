</a>
```

---

### Phase 4: Media Integration

#### 4.1 Images

**Sources used:**
- Existing project gallery images (`/Project-Gallery/`)

**Image optimization checklist:**

- [ ] Caption with context

**Alt text formula:**
```
[Description] in [Location] - [Service type] by ABS Floor Covering [additional context]
```

**Example:**
```

```

#### 4.2 Video Embeds

**YouTube embed format:**
```jsx
<div className="relative w-full" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
  <iframe 
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full rounded-xl shadow-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
    title="Descriptive Title"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>
```

**Placement strategy:**
